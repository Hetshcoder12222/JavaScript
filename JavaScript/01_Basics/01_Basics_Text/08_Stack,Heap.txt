Stack - Primitive
Heap - Reference



üß± Stack
The stack is a memory structure used for storing primitive values and function execution context (like local variables and call frames).

Stores:

Primitive data types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint)
Function calls and local variables
Memory allocation: Automatically managed and fast (LIFO ‚Äì Last In, First Out)




üóÉÔ∏è Heap
The heap is a memory structure used for storing non-primitive (reference) types, such as objects, arrays, and functions.

Stores:

Objects, Arrays, and Functions
Memory allocation: Dynamically managed; slower than stack
