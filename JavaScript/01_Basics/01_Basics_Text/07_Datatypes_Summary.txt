Primitive and Non-Primitive

Primitive
7 Types of Primitive


1.String: 
    Represents textual data. Strings are sequences of characters enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

2.Number: 
    Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. JavaScript numbers are typically stored as double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754.

3.Boolean: 
    Represents a logical entity and can only have one of two values: 
    true or false. Booleans are commonly used for conditional logic.

4.Undefined: 
    Indicates that a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It is also the default return value for functions that do not explicitly return anything. 

5.Null: 
    Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a primitive value that signifies "no value" or "empty."

6.Symbol: 
    Introduced in ES6, Symbol is a unique and immutable primitive value. Symbols are primarily used to create unique property keys for objects, preventing naming collisions. 

7.BigInt: 
    A data type introduced to represent whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1, which is the maximum integer value that the standard Number type can reliably represent. BigInt values are created by appending n to an integer literal or by using the BigInt() constructor.



Non-Primitive(reference)
10 Commonly used Datatypes


1.Object: 
    A collection of key-value pairs.

2.Array: 
    A special type of object for storing ordered lists.

3.Function: 
    A reusable block of code.

4.Date: 
    Represents dates and times.

5.RegExp: 
    Regular expressions for pattern matching in strings.

5.Map: 
    A collection of key-value pairs with keys of any type.

7.Set: 
    A collection of unique values.

7.WeakMap: 
    Like Map, but keys must be objects and are weakly held.

8.WeakMap: 
    Like Map, but keys must be objects and are weakly held.

9.WeakSet: 
    Like Set, but holds only objects and doesn't prevent garbage collection.

10.Error: 
    Used to represent runtime errors.

What is Symbol?
    A symbol is a Datatype that the all things are same but the result will be different.
