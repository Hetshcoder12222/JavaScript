// Difference of txt file and js file:

// Text File (.txt):

// Content: Stores plain text — letters, numbers, symbols — without any structure for code.
// File Extension: .txt.
// Uses: Notes, messages, raw data, configuration files, or even logs.
// Execution: It’s not meant to be directly “executable” by a browser or a scripting engine — it's just raw text.


//  JavaScript File (.js):

// Content: Stores JavaScript code — a scripting or programming language used to add functionality to web pages or applications.
// File Extension: .js.
// Uses: Implementing functionality, adding interactivity, accessing and manipulating HTML elements, performing computations, etc.
// Execution: Executable by a JavaScript engine (like your browser’s or Node.js).
