1.:

The reason is that an equality check == and comparisons > < >= <= work differently.
Comparisons convert null to a number, treating it as 0.
That's why (3) nuil >= 0 is true and (1) null > 0 is false.



Difference between === and == in javascript:

In JavaScript, == and === are comparison operators, but they behave differently:


‚úÖ == (Loose Equality)                                                                         | ‚úÖ === (Strict Equality)
                                                                                                |
Compares values, but ignores the data type.                                                     |Compares both value and data type.
No type conversion is done.                                                                     |Performs type coercion if needed (tries to convert one type to another before comparing).

üîë Summary:

Operator	  |      Compares	    |    Type Conversion?	  |      Safer to Use?
              |                     |                         |
==	          |      Value only	    |     Yes	              |      ‚ùå Risky
===	          |      Value + Type	|     No	              |      ‚úÖ Recommended
